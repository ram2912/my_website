The forecasts are built on your GTM tech-stack, where opportunity data is extracted from CRM, activity data is extracted from Engagement tools like Gong. This data is pre-processed using ML models to create Sales-Cycle Models based on historic deals. This provides expected close dates for open deals which can be pushed to your CRM as fields and Slack as alerts.
